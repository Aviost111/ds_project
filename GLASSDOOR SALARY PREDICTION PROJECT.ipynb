    "As our very first data science project, we have decided to dedicate it to the anticipation of our future in the data science field. In this project, we will be evaluating data science job opportunities in the United States; specifically, we will be prediciting the salaries of different positions depending on several factors. In this way, we could best prepare ourselves for the job opportunities to come (yes, we are optimistic people); in the sense that we will find out which factors play the most important roles and what salaries we should expect, and perhaps we will find more surprises along the way.

Upon the visualization section of this project, we turned back to the cleaning process, as we realized the 'Revenue' column could provide us with a clearer pattern if we would divide it into three distinct categories as opposed to the ones provided. We created a new columb, 'Revenue_Adj', where we placed the revenues into the categories of 'big' (from 1 billion and beyond), 'medium (from 500 million to 1 billion, and 'small' (anything less than 500 million). We also had an 'Unknown/ Non-Applicable' category to take into account any missing values (or any Unknown / Non-Applicable values) in revenue, so as not to assign them to any of the other categories and alter the results."
