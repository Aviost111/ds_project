    "As our very first data science project, we have decided to dedicate it to the anticipation of our future in the data science field. In this project, we will be evaluating data science job opportunities in the United States; specifically, we will be prediciting the salaries of different positions depending on several factors. In this way, we could best prepare ourselves for the job opportunities to come (yes, we are optimistic people); in the sense that we will find out which factors play the most important roles and what salaries we should expect, and perhaps we will find more surprises along the way.

Our upper fence is around a whopping 180k USD, but the box plot reveals that there are quite a bit of outliers beyond that value, almost reaching to 300k USD. That's good news for us future data scientists!\n",

    "Let's note some interesting points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Average Salary has the strongest correlation with Rating, and it is a positive correlation (0.13). Description Length and Competitor Count also have a positive correlation to Average Salary, albeit a weaker one. Age of Company has very weak negative correlation with Average Salary. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rating has a negative correlation with all of the other features, the strongest one being Age of Company. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Age of Company has a positive correlation with both Description Length and Competitor Count. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Description Length has a positive correlation with Competitor Count\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the implications of these notes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Older companies tend to have longer descriptions for job postings, and they have gathered more competitors over the years than younger companies. Due to the correlation of competitors and description length of job postings, it may be that the elaborate job descriptions are used to set apart a company from its competitors. However, while an older company may try to appeal using its job description, or perhaps to demand more from employees, they tend to have a lower rating and in turn a lower salary.\n",
